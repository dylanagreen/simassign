# simassign

`simassign` is a python package designed to loosely wrap around the DESI pacakages [`fiberassign`](https://github.com/desihub/fiberassign) and [`desitarget`](https://github.com/desihub/desitarget/) to simulate the fiber assignment / Merged Target Ledger (MTL) update loop.  `simassign` provides functionality to simulate target assignments for different fields, randomly distributed targets, and target types outside of those defined in the DESI survey (c.f. the DESI [targetmask](https://github.com/desihub/desitarget/blob/main/py/desitarget/data/targetmask.yaml) for more details on DESI targets). `simassign` also allows simulation of DESI targets with different survey strategies than those chosen in DESI.

## Design Philosophy
`simassign` should be straightforward and well documented.

## How it Works
TBD.
